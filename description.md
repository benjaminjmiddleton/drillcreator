## Project Description
We want to create a tool related to the creation of drill for marching bands. That is, the visual aspect of marching
band. Our core idea involves an image-to-drill converter that ensures the created drill is possible for the performers
to march and the ensemble is able to maintain musical cohesiveness in and between the set of drill.
