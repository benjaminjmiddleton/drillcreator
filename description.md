## Project Description

### Abstract
The visual portion of marching band is often referred to as the "drill" that accompanies the music. Industry-standard
tools such Pyware are used to design and create drill for bands across the country. These softwares provide a variety of
tools to aid in the creation of the drill so that users are not manually placing each marcher. However, the software
could stand to be smarter. We want to create a drill creation software that offers intuitive drill creation using image
recognition and provides intelligent feedback as the user edits and creates drill to make the entire process easier,
faster, and more musically successful.

### Current Solutions
As mentioned, drill softwares such as Pyware already exist to provide barebones and a few tools in drill design and
creation. However, they lack features that we believe could be implemented with enough technical know-how that could save
large amounts of time.

### Technical Background
The algorithms necessary to create this image-to-drill conversion, as well as the kind of "intelligent" drill editing
(similar to how current IDEs intelligently suggest line completion for your code) that we imagine are not simple. We will
draw on experience from both classes and co-op to create a complete product with a user-friendly GUI, complex features,
and file compatibility with industry-standard software(s).

### Proposed Approach
