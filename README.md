## Project Abstract
The visual portion of marching band is often referred to as "drill." Industry-standard tools such as Pyware are used to
design and create drill. These softwares provide a variety of tools, but the software could stand to be smarter.
We want to create a set of drill creation tools that automated creation using image recognition and provide intelligent
feedback.
