# Milestones Timeline & Effort Guide

## Milestones List
- Transition solver gives outputs that work at a basic level (11/1/22)
    - The transition solver is the heart of our application. It determines who should move where. Getting a basic version on the algorithm working is critical to our success.
- Image interpreter developed, tested, and working well (2/14/22)
    - One of the main draws to our software is the idea of turning images into a marchable set of marching band dots. It should be simple to add in to the rest of the project, but is of high importance. 
- Finish Qt GUI atop interpreter and transition solver (2/28/22)
    - We need to put significant effort into the GUI and user experience portion of the software so that our algorithms can be used by the average joe (such as a band director).
- Finish Transition solver and drill editor UI (3/25/22)
    - Polishing the transition solver algorithm and the UI will be one of the last milestones in development. At this stage, we should be focusing on ironing out bugs and UI inefficiencies.
